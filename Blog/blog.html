				<h1>Welcome to my Blog</h1>
				<p>I created this blog first of all for myself. Computer science is a wonderful, exciting and very broad field. So I wanted a space where gather information/notes. I thought that I could write some article for explain or summarize some concepts of my interest. Explain something help me to understand and memorize these concepts.<br><br>
						
				I decided to publish all of this on internet for two reasons. Firstly I can access to this content everywhere with any device with internet connection. Secondly I hope that my work is useful for other people: worker, student or anyone interested of the topics I deal with.<br><br>

				Please if you find some error in my articles or you think that some concepts are unclear write me an email. Can you find my mail on my site by click on my name in the top of this page.
